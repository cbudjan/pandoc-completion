This is a bash autocompletion script for pandoc.

It supports autocompletion of options, as well as autocompletion of
file paths in the pandoc data directory and $HOME/.csl, where 
appropriate.

It is messy. I don't know a lot about writing bash completion scripts,
and I find that the documentation is rather thin. But it works for me.

Improvements welcome.
